A simple React app that displays data from JSON file.

Clone this repo or download zip and run <code>npm install</code>, and then <code>npm start</code> to run development server. After making changes use <code>npm run build</code> for production code. Paths to css, js, json and manifest files was changed manually to absolute paths, because GitHub have a problem with them being relative on GitHub pages - locally they work on localhost:3000. PWA is not configured, so there is an error in the console.
